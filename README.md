# ControllingNetworks
Application requested by a mathematician working with the Aquinicum Institute of Technology to calculate 2 features of real world networks which represent the controllability of a network.
Application to work on calculating features of a network which represent the controllability of a network.These features are minimal feedback vertex set control and structural controllability.
